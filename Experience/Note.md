# We should define data type for values

✅ Do this

```kotlin
val ryusoulRed: Ryusoulger = Ryusoulger();
```

❌ Shouldn't do this 

```kotlin
val ryusoulRed = Ryusoulger();
```
Because when we debug or maintain projects, this type of writing helps us debug or maintain them faster and more easily. In Kotlin, it will improve the app's performance.
